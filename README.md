# What is the difference between Functional Programming and Object-Oriented Programming?
- Functional Programming, FP
  - avoid changing state, avoid changing data
  - pure function
  - avoid side effect
  - share state
  - immutability
  - focus on the result, rather than processing
  - There are two major concpts: 
    - Fist Class Object : assgin a function as parameter into another function
    - Scope
    
```javascript

const add = (a, b) => a + b; 
const multiple = (a, b) => a * b; 
add(1, multiple(2, 3)) // Functional Composition

```


- Objected-Oriented Programming
